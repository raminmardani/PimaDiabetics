# PimaDiabetics
This dataset provides us with information of diabetes diagnosed or not based on the number of pregnancy times, glucose, bp (blood pressure), skin (skin thickness), insulin, bmi, pedigree, age. In this project, Artificial Neural Network is fitted to data to predict if the patient has diabetes or not.

# Analysis Outline:
1. Data Exploration

2. Fitting a preliminery Neural Network Model

3. Examining a methodology to optimize the model parameters and hyper parameters: Using Grid Search to optimize all the parameters at a same time

4. Examining orthogonalization methodoloy to optimize the model parameters and hyper parameters: Using Grid Search to optimize the important parameters separately in a sequence. As the next steps, ROC curve of the model was improved by adjusting the threshold.

5. Examining model performance using only important features
